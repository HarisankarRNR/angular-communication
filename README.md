# Angular Component Communication Project

## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview
This project focuses on **Component Communication** in Angular (v17+ using the Standalone API). The goal is to:

1. Use `@Input` to pass a product object from a parent component to a child component for a detailed display.
2. Use `@Output` and `EventEmitter` to allow the child component to notify the parent when a product is added, edited, or deleted.
3. Create a shared service to manage product data and facilitate communication between sibling components.
